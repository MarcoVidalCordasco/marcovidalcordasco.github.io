     As I began my postdoctoral period, I quickly realised that applying for projects is essential not only for carrying out research but also for increasing the chances of building a successful career. However, during the PhD—which is meant to give scientists research autonomy—there is often no formal training, structured guidance, or even basic advice on how to prepare a competitive research proposal.
     Moreover, there are not many opportunities available in general, and even fewer for postdocs. Most research funding schemes require that you already hold a contract for the entire duration of the project. But as postdocs, we are often academic nomads, which makes it difficult to even be eligible for most calls (at least in Spain). Still, there are some exceptions—such as the MSCA or grants funded by private foundations like Wenner-Gren or Leakey.
While preparing one of these proposals, I came across the paper “Elements of Successful NIH Grant Applications”. I found it genuinely inspiring, offering practical and valuable advice on how to approach writing a research project. The authors highlight five key principles:
-The application is for the reviewer, not for you—always remember that.
-Learn from the Greeks—communicate through stories.
-Your Specific Aims story must be cohesive—leave no puzzling gaps.
-Motivate the reviewer to keep reading—make your story resonate.
-There is serendipity and noise in the peer-review system—accept it.
These may sound like “basic” rules or even truisms, but nothing could be further from the truth. They provide a valuable big-picture perspective and prompt you to reflect, rethink, and structure your project in a clear, compelling way—and perhaps most importantly, to enjoy the process.
