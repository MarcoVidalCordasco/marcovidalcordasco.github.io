      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
       During the Late Pleistocene, Europe witnessed the onset of a mass extinction process and transformations in human culture, diet and demography.
        While most research has focused on understanding the causes of this biodiversity crisis, the consequences of these extinctions on the human-environment 
        relationships remain overlooked. This project will disentangle the effects of biodiversity losses on the food chain regulation processes and their linkage
        with the transformations in the human niche in northern Iberia. Sedimentary ancient DNA recovered from dated peat bog cores and two new archaeological 
        sites, along with data obtained from additional archaeo-paleontological levels in the region will be used to evaluate the evolution of the mammal and 
        plant richness. High-resolution palynological records and stable oxygen and carbon isotopes obtained from stalagmites will be used to test climate 
        simulations. This information will be incorporated into a dynamic vegetation model to quantify the effects of climate changes on plant biomass. 
        A macroecological model will compute the impact of the plant richness and biomass transformations on the abundance of mammals. By computing the biomass
        flux in the terrestrial food webs, we will provide new insights into the role of human populations in the structure and vulnerability of trophic networks.

      <h2>My Contributions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Since 2021, I have developed a novel methodology to estimate herbivore carrying capacity during MIS3, based on: (1) net primary productivity estimated using the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS, (2) the number and types of herbivore species in each paleocommunity, and (3) the body size of these species. This method was validated with over 600 herbivore density surveys worldwide.
        </li>
        <li>
          I analyzed these carrying capacity estimates in the context of the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition in Iberia and Europe, complementing traditional Bayesian age models with Optimal Linear Estimations—a method borrowed from Ecology recently applied in archaeology to estimate extinction times.
        </li>
        <li>
          The results indicate that regional differences in Neanderthal disappearance and <em>Homo sapiens</em> arrival were not random: regions with higher carrying capacity of medium-sized herbivores witnessed longer Neanderthal persistence and earlier arrival of <em>Homo sapiens</em>, resulting in prolonged coexistence between the species.

        </li>
        <li>
          I also built Species Distribution Models (GLM, GAM, MaxEnt, and BART) for primary and secondary consumer species, analyzing fluctuations in habitat favorability relative to their co-occurrence patterns. This work, currently under review, shows that the arrival of <em>Homo sapiens</em> significantly altered previous species co-occurrence networks by simplifying their structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          My latest contribution is an Agent-Based Model integrating carrying capacity estimates and potential spatial distributions (based on SDMs) to assess whether climate or the arrival of <em>Homo sapiens</em> was the main driver of Neanderthal demise in Europe. This study is also under review.
